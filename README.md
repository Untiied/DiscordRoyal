# Discord Royal

Battle royal brought to the discord platform!

# The Philosophy

Discord battle royal is going to be (n) number of people in a server, where their objective is to be the last one surviving.
We need to come up with an objective that will need to be solved inorder to proccede into the next "level."

We also need to decide whether it will be progressive or parallel.
